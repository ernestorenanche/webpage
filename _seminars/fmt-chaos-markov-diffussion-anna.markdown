title: The Nualart-Peccati theorem for chaotic Markov diffusion generators
speaker: anna

In 2009, Nourdin and Peccati used Stein-Malliavin approach to prove quantitative versions of so-called Fourth Moment Theorems (FMT) (MathSciNet: [MR2520122](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2520122)).
Their results state that, under certain circumstances, convergence of sequence of Gaussian functionnals towards a target distribution (for example Gaussian) is controlled by the convergence of the first four moments of the approximating sequence.

Recently, Ledoux (MathSciNet: [MR3050508](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3050508)) and Azmoodeh, Campese and Poly (MathSciNet: [MR3150163](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3150163)) provided a purely spectral point of view on the FMT.
Indeed they show analogues of these results continue to hold in the more abstract setting of Markov diffusion generators.
Moreover, in this more general setting, we can also cover other chaos structures and target distributions.
As our own application we give a novel quantitative Fourth Moment Theorem for convergence towards a Beta distribution.
