Using a refinement of the concentration function, we show that the "eigenvalues" of the metric heat operator concentrate the space exponentially.
The result has been known for a long time for the first eigenvalue (that is for operator satisfying a Poincaré inequality that is for CD(0, N)) but this is the first time we are able to take into account higher order eigenvalues.
As a corollary, we obtain a bound on the growth of the eigenvalues which might possibly be used to bound the variance of the carré du champ without using the techniques of ACP (I have not thought about that in detail but it seems doable).

This is a joint current work with [Nathaël Gozlan](http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/gozlan.nathael/).
