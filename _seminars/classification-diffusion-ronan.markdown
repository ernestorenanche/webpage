title: Classification of diffusive generators associated to orthogonal polynomial on the real line
speaker: ronan

A diagonalizable symmetric Markov generator gives rise to two orthonormal basis: one obtained from the Gram-Schmidt ortho-normalization procedure and the other given by the eigenfunctions.
In the case the two coincide, the generator satisfies the property of chaos-eigenfunctions as defined in the previous seminar.
On the real line an article of O. Mazet (Numdam: [SPS_1997__31__40_0](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=SPS_1997__31__40_0)) shows that the only generators with orthogonal eigenfunctions are: Gaussian (Hermite polynomials); Exponential (Laguerre polynomials) and Beta (Jacobi).
The case of the real plane is exhausted in a recent paper by  D. Bakry, S. Orekov & M. Zani (arXiv: [1309.5632v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5632v2)).

We will investigate two open questions:

* Is there chaos-eigenfunctions outside of the orthogonal ones?
* What if the dimension is greater than 2?
