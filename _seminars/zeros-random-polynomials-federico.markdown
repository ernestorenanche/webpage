In the first place I will try to motivate why people are interested in random polynomials and its roots and I will do a brief review about the classical known results about the number of roots of random polynomials.
Then, I will tell you about my recent efforts in the case of trigonometric polynomials of the form {% m %}\sum a_n \cos(n t){% endm %} and on systems of (algebraic) polynomials.
