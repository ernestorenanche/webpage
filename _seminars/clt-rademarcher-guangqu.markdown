title: Normal approximation and almost sure central limit theorem in the Rademarcher setting
speaker: guanqu

In this talk, we study the central limit theorem and almost sure central limit theorems for some functionals of an independent sequence of Rademacher random variables.
In particular, we derive an approximate chain rule that refines the one discovered by [I. Nourdin](https://sites.google.com/site/ivannourdin/home), [G. Peccati](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home) and [G. Reinert](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/academic_staff/gesine_reinert) (MathSciNet: [MR2735379](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2735379)) and then we deduce the bound on Wasserstein distance for normal approximation using the (discrete) Malliavin-Stein approach.
We are also able to give the almost sure central limit theorem for a sequence inside a fixed Rademacher chaos using the Ibragimov-Lifshits criterion.

This is work in progress.
