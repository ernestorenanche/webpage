title: The Bakry-Emery theory of the Ricci curvature in the Riemannian setting
speaker: ronan
---
In classical Riemannian geometry, the Ricci curvature controls how the volume grows along parallel transport by geodesics.
Informations on the Ricci curvature imply many infamous functionals inequalities (Levy-Gromov, Poincaré and so on).
On a weighted Riemannian manifold, the hypothesis of Ricci bounded below is in fact equivalent to the well-known Böchner formula for fields deriving from a potential.
Using this equality [D. Bakry](http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~bakry/) & M. Emery introduced the so-called *curvature-dimension* inequality characterizing bounds from below for the Ricci curvature (MathSciNet: [MR889476](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=889476)).

This inequality is in fact purely algebraic and can be expressed for an abstract Markov generator.
Roughly speaking, it measures the sub-commutation property of the generator with its so-called carré du champ.
Generators satisfying the curvature dimension inequality, then all the inequalities proved in he Riemannian case stay valid in that abstract setting.

The talk is based on the lecture notes of [M. Ledoux](http://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/ledoux/) (Numdam: [AFST_2000_6_9_2_305_0](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=AFST_2000_6_9_2_305_0)) and the speaker personal notes on a course by [C. Villani](http://cedricvillani.org/) (Youtube: [xzVk56EKBUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzVk56EKBUI)).
