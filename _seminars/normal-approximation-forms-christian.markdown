title: Normal approximation of generalized multilinear forms
speaker: christian
---
This talk deals with a quantitative version of a Theorem by de Jong from 1990 which states that a homogeneous sum of a certain class of uncorrelated functionals of some independent data converges to a normal limit, if its fourth moment converges to 3 and if, additionally, some negligibility condition which extends the classical Feller condition holds true.
This theorem generalizes known results about asymptotic normality of multilinear forms in independent random variables which have been the object of intense research in the past.

The proof relies on a combination of a suitable version of Stein's method and the probabilistic structure behind the given random variables.
This is joint work in progress with [Giovanni Peccati](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home).
