title: Markov generators in the no-diffusive case
speaker: anna
---
Is it possible to adapt the Ledoux (MathSciNet: [MR3050508](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3050508)) and Azmoodeh, Campese and Poly (MathSciNet: [MR3150163](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3150163)) spectral methods to prove Fourth Moment Theorems in a framework that is not diffusive?
Starting from Rademacher and Poisson settings, we try to give a definition of a quasi-diffusive generator.
The main difficulty os to compute exact bounds on the error term in the 'chain rule' for the generator.
