title: Length of zero-set of random eigenfunctions on the torus

*Arithmetic random waves* are the Gaussian Laplace eigenfunctions on the two-dimensional torus. It was conjectured by Bogomolny and Schmit that the nodal domains of random (and chaotic) wavefunctions in the semi-classical limit are adequately described by the critical percolation theory. The connection with SLE (which describes the limit of some percolation problem and was supposed to approximate nodal lines of these random wavefunctions) gave additional support to this conjecture.

In this talk we show that the nodal length of random eigenfunctions on the torus converges to a non-universal (non-Gaussian) limiting distribution, depending on the angular distribution of lattice points lying on circles. Our argument has two main ingredients. An explicit derivation of the Wiener-Ito chaos expansion for the nodal length shows that it is dominated by its 4th order chaos component (in particular, somewhat surprisingly, the second order chaos component vanishes - this is closely related to the so-called ''obscure'' Berry's cancellation phenomenon). The rest of the argument relies on the precise analysis of the fourth order chaotic component.

This talk is based on the paper Non-Universality of Nodal Length Distribution for Arithmetic Random Waves (arXiv: [1508.00353](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00353)), joint work with [Domenico Marinucci](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~marinucc/) (Università di Roma Tor Vergata), [Giovanni Peccati](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home) (Université du Luxembourg) and [Igor Wigman](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/mathematics/people/atoz/wigmani.aspx) (King's College London).
