title: Improved second order Poincaré inequality for functionals of Gaussian fields and applications
speaker: anna
---
In this talk I present a new second order Poincaré inequality for functionals of a Gaussian field and, among many other possible applications, I show how to apply it to the trace of a power {% m %}p_n=o(n^{1/3}){% endm %} of a Wigner matrix, in order to give a quantitative CLT for the aforementioned, and to a non-linear functional of a Gaussian field.

This is a joint work in progress with my supervisor, Professor [Giovanni Peccati](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home).
