In <time datetime="2015-09-01">September 2015</time>, I graduated with great honours in the [master program in analysis and probability](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~fejoz/analyse-probabilites/) of the Univeristé Paris Dauphine.
During that program I had the opportunity to confirm my knowledges in the classical theory of stochastic calculus and PDE through advanced lectures.
I also got familiar with some research subjects in that field.
In particular, I had the occasion to work with [D. Chafaï](http://djalil.chafai.net/) on Bakry-Emery {% m %}\Gamma{% endm %}-calculus in sub-Riemannian geometry (a subject I discovered by pure randomness during [a school at IHP](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/subriemannian/)).
\\
More particularly, I was interested in the log-Sobolev inequality on the simplest non-trivial Carnot group: the Heisenberg group.
Since the standard technique of {% m %}\Gamma{% endm %}-calculus could not work and that direct computations do not lead to an optimal constant, I adapted an argument of L. Gross based on an exact log-Sobolev inequality on the two-spaces.
The non-commutativity yields a weighted gradient.

[N. Gozlan](http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/gozlan.nathael/) and [G. Peccati](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home) offered me to keep on working the field of functional inequality as a PhD student co-supervised by the two of them.
Roughly speaking, I try to understand the geometry of (eventually non-smooth) spaces (graphs, infinite dimensional spaces from probability theory, sub-Riemannian manifolds).
To that extend, I study:

* the geometry of Markov generators and their chaos;
* optimal transport;
* functional inequalities (concentration, Sobolev of logarithmic type, isoperimetric, super-concentration);
* geometric measure theory;
* metric differential calculus (heat equation on metric spaces).

Since I arrived in Luxembourg, I also gained interest in the geometry used in physical mathematics.

I co-organise a weekly [workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop-probability) in probability where people of the research group explain their current work.
