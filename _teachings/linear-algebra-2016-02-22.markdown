You will be assigned weekly homeworks that you hand me the following week at the beginning of the course.
I will then give an extended correction.
After the session, I will post the correction on moodle.
At the end of the semester, based on you work, you will be awarded a bonus (from 0 to 2) to your score at the exam.
