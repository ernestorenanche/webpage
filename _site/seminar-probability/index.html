The result has been known for a long time for the first eigenvalue (that is for operator satisfying a Poincaré inequality that is for CD(0, N)) but this is the first time we are able to take into account higher order eigenvalues. As a corollary, we obtain a bound on the growth of the eigenvalues which might possibly be used to bound the variance of the carré du champ without using the techniques of ACP (I have not thought about that in detail but it seems doable).</p><p>This is a joint current work with <a href="http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/gozlan.nathael/">Nathaël Gozlan</a>.</p></article></li><li> <article> <header><p> <time datetime="2016-02-24 10:00:00 +0100" class="info">24 February 2016 at 10:00</time> by <span rel="author">F.

This theorem generalizes known results about asymptotic normality of multilinear forms in independent random variables which have been the object of intense research in the past.</p><p>The proof relies on a combination of a suitable version of Stein’s method and the probabilistic structure behind the given random variables.

Rossi</a></p><h4>Length of zero-set of random eigenfunctions on the torus</h4> </header><p><em>Arithmetic random waves</em> are the Gaussian Laplace eigenfunctions on the two-dimensional torus. It was conjectured by Bogomolny and Schmit that the nodal domains of random (and chaotic) wavefunctions in the semi-classical limit are adequately described by the critical percolation theory. The connection with SLE (which describes the limit of some percolation problem and was supposed to approximate nodal lines of these random wavefunctions) gave additional support to this conjecture.</p><p>In this talk we show that the nodal length of random eigenfunctions on the torus converges to a non-universal (non-Gaussian) limiting distribution, depending on the angular distribution of lattice points lying on circles. Our argument has two main ingredients. An explicit derivation of the Wiener-Ito chaos expansion for the nodal length shows that it is dominated by its 4th order chaos component (in particular, somewhat surprisingly, the second order chaos component vanishes - this is closely related to the so-called ‘‘obscure’’ Berry’s cancellation phenomenon). The rest of the argument relies on the precise analysis of the fourth order chaotic component.</p><p>This talk is based on the paper Non-Universality of Nodal Length Distribution for Arithmetic Random Waves (arXiv: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00353">1508.00353</a>), joint work with <a href="https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~marinucc/">Domenico Marinucci</a> (Università di Roma Tor Vergata), <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home">Giovanni Peccati</a> (Université du Luxembourg) and <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/mathematics/people/atoz/wigmani.aspx">Igor Wigman</a> (King’s College London).</p></article></li><li> <article> <header><p> <time datetime="2016-02-03 14:00:00 +0100" class="info">3 February 2016 at 14:00</time> by <span rel="author">A.

Starting from Rademacher and Poisson settings, we try to give a definition of a quasi-diffusive generator. The main difficulty os to compute exact bounds on the error term in the ‘chain rule’ for the generator.</p></article></li><li> <article> <header><p> <time datetime="2016-01-13 14:00:00 +0100" class="info">13 January 2016 at 14:00</time> by <a href="http://math.uni.lu/~herry/" rel="author">R. Herry</a></p><h4>Classification of diffusive generators associated to orthogonal polynomial on the real line</h4> </header><p>A diagonalizable symmetric Markov generator gives rise to two orthonormal basis: one obtained from the Gram-Schmidt ortho-normalization procedure and the other given by the eigenfunctions. In the case the two coincide, the generator satisfies the property of chaos-eigenfunctions as defined in the previous seminar. On the real line an article of O. Mazet (Numdam: <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=SPS_1997__31__40_0">SPS_1997__31__40_0</a>) shows that the only generators with orthogonal eigenfunctions are: Gaussian (Hermite polynomials); Exponential (Laguerre polynomials) and Beta (Jacobi). The case of the real plane is exhausted in a recent paper by D. Bakry, S. Orekov &amp; M. Zani (arXiv: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5632v2">1309.5632v2</a>).</p><p>We will investigate two open questions:</p><ul><li>Is there chaos-eigenfunctions outside of the orthogonal ones?</li><li>What if the dimension is greater than 2?</li></ul></article></li><li> <article> <header><p> <time datetime="2015-12-16 14:00:00 +0100" class="info">16 December 2015 at 14:00</time> by <span rel="author">A.

Their results state that, under certain circumstances, convergence of sequence of Gaussian functionnals towards a target distribution (for example Gaussian) is controlled by the convergence of the first four moments of the approximating sequence.</p><p>Recently, Ledoux (MathSciNet: <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3050508">MR3050508</a>) and Azmoodeh, Campese and Poly (MathSciNet: <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3150163">MR3150163</a>) provided a purely spectral point of view on the FMT. Indeed they show analogues of these results continue to hold in the more abstract setting of Markov diffusion generators. Moreover, in this more general setting, we can also cover other chaos structures and target distributions. As our own application we give a novel quantitative Fourth Moment Theorem for convergence towards a Beta distribution.</p></article></li><li> <article> <header><p> <time datetime="2015-12-11 14:00:00 +0100" class="info">11 December 2015 at 14:00</time> by <span rel="author">G.

In particular, we derive an approximate chain rule that refines the one discovered by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ivannourdin/home">I. Nourdin</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home">G. Peccati</a> and <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/academic_staff/gesine_reinert">G. Reinert</a> (MathSciNet: <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2735379">MR2735379</a>) and then we deduce the bound on Wasserstein distance for normal approximation using the (discrete) Malliavin-Stein approach. We are also able to give the almost sure central limit theorem for a sequence inside a fixed Rademacher chaos using the Ibragimov-Lifshits criterion.</p><p>This is work in progress.</p></article></li><li> <article> <header><p> <time datetime="2015-09-12 14:00:00 +0200" class="info">12 September 2015 at 14:00</time> by <a href="http://math.uni.lu/~herry/" rel="author">R.

Informations on the Ricci curvature imply many infamous functionals inequalities (Levy-Gromov, Poincaré and so on). On a weighted Riemannian manifold, the hypothesis of Ricci bounded below is in fact equivalent to the well-known Böchner formula for fields deriving from a potential. Using this equality <a href="http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~bakry/">D. Bakry</a> &amp; M. Emery introduced the so-called <em>curvature-dimension</em> inequality characterizing bounds from below for the Ricci curvature (MathSciNet: <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=889476">MR889476</a>).</p><p>This inequality is in fact purely algebraic and can be expressed for an abstract Markov generator. Roughly speaking, it measures the sub-commutation property of the generator with its so-called carré du champ. Generators satisfying the curvature dimension inequality, then all the inequalities proved in he Riemannian case stay valid in that abstract setting.</p><p>The talk is based on the lecture notes of <a href="http://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/ledoux/">M.
