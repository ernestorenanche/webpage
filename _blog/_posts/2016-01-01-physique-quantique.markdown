title: Superposition principle and the paradigm of quantum physics
---
Science study objects and relation between those objects.
For instance, an high school teacher in physics would tell its student that dynamics is about rigid bodies exerting attractive forces to each other while a psychanalyst would tell you that it is all about understanding the building of the unconscious mind (Unbewusste) through the structure of the speech.
Objects, observable relations among them and a discourse of that observation.
It woulb be *inconceivable* to take science away from this solid clear rock methodology.
However, this is what the N. Bohr and W. Heisenberg said about quantum physics: there are no objects.
How then could one do science? And what would science be all about if there are no objects?

Of course there are objects.
However instead of defining them a priori, one define them by the two following fundamental properties.

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Superposition principle</div>
<div class="panel-body">Two objects can be *added* to give birth to an other object. The new object is said to be the *superposition* of he two previous.</div>
</div>

Here we do not specify how to *add* two objects, we *state* that such an addition exist.
One of the most obvious example of mathematical formalism representing such a principle is the one of *linear spaces* whose elements are called *vectors*.
Therefore it is standard to represent quantum objects
